# What is Rocket League?

Rocket League is video game soccer played in cars. Each player controls their own car. Games last 5 minutes and the game-mode that I explored for the purposes of this project was the 3v3 mode.

# Project Goals

The main goal of my project was to train a model on professional Rocket League games and use that model to predict match outcomes (Win/Loss) for other professional Rocket League games. I wanted to get an idea of which variables in the dataset were most associated with winning games (besides obvious predictors like goals scored), and use these findings to figure out whether certain approaches/tactics that different professional teams utilize are more or less effective.

# Methods

I went into the project with an idea of two different statistical learning methods that I was going to attempt to predict game outcome with. The first was Lasso Regression, and the second was a Random Forest approach. After seeing the first few attempts at each of the models, it became clear that the Random Forest approach would be a much more effective modeling approach so that is what I focused the majority of my time on.

# What is Random Forest?

Random Forest is a 

# Results

In the end, I created a random forest model that predicted Rocket League game outcome with 86.35% accuracy. From every model that I created, there became a few clear predictor variables that were the strongest; teams with the most positioning time goalside of the ball and teams who got the most shots off during the game had a much better chance of winning those matches. I think that this helps reinforce the idea that constant pressure in the opponents' half remains the most effective strategy in Rocket League. 


```{r mytable, out.width='80%'}
knitr::kable(iris[1:10, 1:4], caption = 'Table caption.',align = 'c',"html")
```

Or with figures: Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), or Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs).

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=5}
plot(mtcars[1:2])
```

```{r morefigs, out.width='80%', echo=TRUE, fig.cap='Amazing, right?!', fig.height=5}
data <- iris

plot(x = data$Sepal.Length, 
     y = data$Sepal.Width, 
     col = data$Species,
     pch = 19, 
     xlab = "Sepal Length (cm)",
     ylab = "Sepal Width (cm)")

```

# Next Steps

Aliquam sed faucibus risus, quis efficitur erat. Vestibulum semper mauris quis tempus eleifend. Aliquam sagittis dictum ipsum, quis viverra ligula eleifend ut. Curabitur sagittis vitae arcu eget faucibus. In non elementum felis. Duis et aliquam nunc. Nunc pulvinar sapien nunc, vel pretium nisi efficitur in. Fusce fringilla maximus leo et maximus. Fusce at ligula laoreet, iaculis mi at, auctor odio. Praesent sed elementum justo. Aenean consectetur risus rhoncus tincidunt efficitur. Praesent dictum mauris at diam maximus maximus [@R-posterdown].

# Conclusion

Interestingly, although Rocket League coaches are constantly talking about keeping your car's movement speed high throughout the duration of the match, variables related to car speed had little to no effect on predicting game outcome.
