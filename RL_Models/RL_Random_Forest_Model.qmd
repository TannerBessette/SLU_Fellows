Load in necessary libraries:
```{r}
library(janitor)
library(tree)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
library(caret)
```


Read in dataset:
```{r}
library(here)
RL_numeric <- read_csv(here("RL_Datasets/RL_numeric.csv"), 
        col_types = cols(winner_factor = readr::col_factor()))
```


Build Random Forest Model:
```{r}
set.seed(993)
RL_splits <- group_initial_split(RL_numeric, group = series_id, prop = 0.8)
RL_train <- training(RL_splits)
RL_test <- testing(RL_splits)

RL_resamples <- group_vfold_cv(RL_train, v = 5, group = series_id)

RL_train_tree <- tree(winner_factor ~ . - series_id, data = RL_train)

plot(RL_train_tree)
text(RL_train_tree)
```


Get predictions and calculate model classification accuracy:
```{r}
RL_fit <- fit(RL_workflow, data = RL_train)
RL_predictions <- predict(RL_fit, new_data = RL_test)
predictions <- predict(RL_train_tree, newdata = RL_test)
# if more than 50% likely 
predictions <- if_else(predictions > 0.5, 
                       true = TRUE, 
                       false = FALSE)
accuracy <- mean(RL_predictions == RL_test$winner_factor)
accuracy
```

The Random Forest model predicted game outcome with 95.537% accuracy.


Cleaner visual of the random forest tree output:
```{r}
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
clean_tree <- rpart(winner_factor ~ . - series_id, data = RL_train)
clean_tree
rpart.plot(clean_tree)
```
